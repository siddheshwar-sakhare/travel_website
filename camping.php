       <h3>What is <span>Camping</span>?</h3>
       <p>Camping is a form of outdoor recreation or outdoor education involving overnight stays with a basic temporary shelter such as a tent. Camping can also include a recreational vehicle, sheltered cabins, a permanent tent, a shelter such as a bivy or tarp, or no shelter at all. Typically, participants leave developed areas to spend time outdoors, in pursuit of activities providing them enjoyment or an educational experience. Spending the night away from home distinguishes camping from day-tripping, picnicking, and other outdoor activities.
                        </p>

<p>Camping as a recreational activity became popular among elites in the early 20th century. With time, it grew in popularity among other socioeconomic classes. Modern campers frequent publicly owned natural resources such as national and state parks, wilderness areas, and commercial campgrounds. In a few countries, such as Sweden and Scotland, public camping is legal on privately held land as well. Camping is a key part of many youth organizations around the world, such as Scouting, which use it to teach both self-reliance and teamwork. School camping trips also have numerous benefits and can play an essential role in the personal growth and development of students.</p>
        
        
            <p>Camping describes a range of activities and approaches to outdoor accommodation. Survivalist and wild campers typically set off with as little as possible to get by. Other campers might use specialized camping gear designed to provide comfort, including their own power and heat sources as well as camping furniture. Camping may be combined with hiking, as in backpacking, and is often enjoyed in conjunction with other outdoor activities such as canoeing, kayaking, climbing, fishing, and hunting. Fastpacking involves both running and camping.

There is no universally held definition of what is and what is not camping. Just as with motels, which serve both recreational and business guests, the same campground may serve recreational campers, school field trips, migrant workers, and homeless at the same time. Fundamentally, it reflects a combination of intent and the nature of activities involved. A children's summer camp with dining hall meals and bunkhouse accommodations may have "camp" in its name but fails to reflect the spirit and form of "camping" as it is broadly understood. Similarly, a homeless person's lifestyle may involve many common camping activities, such as sleeping out and preparing meals over a fire but fails to reflect the elective nature and pursuit of spirit rejuvenation that are an integral aspect of camping. Likewise, cultures with itinerant lifestyles or lack of permanent dwellings cannot be said to be "camping" as this is considered their way of life.</p>
            <h3>Why we use Camping <span>?</span></h3>
            <p>When you're camping, you get a chance to get in touch with nature, encounter wildlife and see the stars away from the bright lights of the big city. There's nothing quite like it. Make sure you and your family have the chance to connect with nature when you explore the many benefits of camping.</p>

            <h3>Important reasons for <span>Camping</span></h3>
            <h4>1. Camping helps with problem solving.</h4>
            <img src="images/camping4.jpg" style="margin-bottom:4rem;"alt="camping image" >
            <h4>2. Camping is great for children’s education</h4>
            <img src="images/camping5.jpg" style="margin-bottom:4rem;"alt="camping image" >
            <h4>3. Camping can help you sleep better.</h4>
            <p>Research from the University of Colorado Boulder found that camping can reset our biological clocks and help those of us who find it tough to get to sleep and/or wake up in the morning.

In short, it’s a result of the increased use of artificial light in our daily lives and the fact that camping can help us to adjust to the natural light-dark cycle if we're given that chance.

Receiving adequate sleep has long been touted as critical to our overall health and wellbeing. Plus, aren’t we all much better company when we aren’t tired and grumpy?!</p>
            <h4>4. Camping can lead to increased exercise.</h4>
            <p>If your daily routine entails long periods being seated, chances are your opportunities to exercise are limited. The solution? Go camping.

While camping, you will likely explore new surrounds; perhaps wandering through a nearby national park or cycling or kayaking. Or, when staying at a BIG4 park, taking advantage of ample on-site leisure facilities that are generally on offer.

This increased exercise has been well-documented – from the Heart Foundation to the Department of Health – as having myriad physical and mental benefits. These include combatting health problems and disease and improving your mood and energy levels.

Such a point is not limited to camping. Simply hit the road and escape the daily grind or your regular routine.</p>
            <h4>5. Camping makes you happier</h4>
            <p>
That’s right – camping goes a long way to improving your mood. It’s all to do with serotonin, that wonderful chemical our body produces that helps to make us happy.

We’ve already touched on some factors that help the body create serotonin: more sunlight, more oxygen, and increased physical activity.

And when you’re camping, you’re likely to tick all these boxes. Happy days!</p>
