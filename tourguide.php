       <h3> <span>TOUR GUIDE</span></h3>
       <p>A tour guide helps you explore the unexplored streets, corners, food joints, and architectural structures, cultural and historical information. They also help you see the best version of the country you are visiting. There are several benefits of having a guide onboard while travelling abroad.

  <h3>Reasons for hiring a guide:</h3>

           
                <h4>1. A guide will tailor a tour to your needs and tastes.</h4>
                <p>
A guide can create your itinerary, arrange your accommodations and transportation and even probably save you money. He/She can offer tips on where and what to eat, what to enjoy and what to avoid. He/She can adjust and deliver a family-friendly tour to a family with children or a fact-filled one to a group of history buffs. A knowledgeable guide can emphasize on the important facts of any sightseeing visit, and this will prove quite valuable especially when you have very little time in one place. This is a very common occurrence when on a cruise with limited time at each port.

                        </p>

                        <h4>2. A guide can take you to places that you would never know about.</h4>
                        <p>
Even if you spend hours searching the Internet or reading guide books, you will never really know the lesser-known places of interest. A good guide can tell you all the best places frequented by the locals and how to experience your trip as a true insider.
                        </p>
 

<h4>3. A guide will point out things that you would never notice.</h4>
<p>
A guide will explain and make sense of what you are looking at. He/She will make what may seem as a pile of stones come alive! A guide will put what you are seeing in its historical, religious and cultural context. He/She can answer questions about anything that sparks your curiosity. He/She will tell you about the customs, habits and morals of the people and explain what makes the country different from yours.

                        </p>

<h4>4. Using a guide is the best use of your time.</h4>
<p>
The hassles of obtaining tickets, making reservations, checking operating hours are easy for a good tour guide. A tour guide will always know the best hours to visit attractions, when prices are best, which places you can skip and any number of tricks and tactics that will help you get the most out of travel to a heavily visited location. A good guide might bring you to an attraction in the morning before the crowds arrive, or arrange for a private, after-hours tour. You’ll get to do and see more when hiring an expert.
                        </p>
 
<h4>5. A guide is educated and trained to guide and then licensed by the Greek Ministry of Tourism.</h4>
<p>
You need to be a university degree holder in History/Archaeology/Arts and then to attend a 2-month seminar for tour guides in order to become certified. Only certified tourist guides by the Greek Ministry of Tourism may conduct tours within archeological sites and museums in Greece. Licensed guides can be recognized by the badge they have to wear when on duty.
                        </p>
 

<h4>6. A guide is your personal resource.</h4>
<p>
He/She can answer your questions and is able to suggest things that match your interests, both before and during your trip. In places that are exceptionally rich in historical or cultural significance, an educated tour guide can offer a depth of experience and knowledge to which no guidebook, audio guide or plaque-reading will come even close. A good guide can explain the stories behind the monument, temple or statue and is always up-to-date with the facts.
                        </p>
 

<h4>7. A guide is a new-found friend in a foreign country</h4>
<p>
When hiring a tourist guide when abroad, you will always have your personal connection in that country. You can always contact your guide and inquire information, refer your friends or book your next trip easily and hassle-free, while saving a whole lot.

 

Although a certified tourist guide is an optional service when visiting, it is worth your time and effort investing in one. A guide will enhance your experience of this country and will save you a lot of time, money and hassle.</p>

                        <h4>What work activities does a <span>TOUR GUIDE</span> perform ?</h4>

                            <p>Tour guides are professionals who show a group of people certain places of interest, such as the monuments of a city or the different rooms of a museum, for example. 
Tour guides must offer tours that are not only informative, but also entertaining and enjoyable. Likewise, they must do prior research on the places they are talking about and document themselves extensively. They must be prepared not only to give their tour, but also to answer visitors\’ questions. 
Nowadays, tours are becoming more and more interactive and include additional materials such as photographs, videos and even games. In addition, there are many outdoor tours, which allows the visits to be very varied and makes it easier for each guide to adapt the tour to his or her taste. </p>

                        <br />
                        <h3>Advantages of hiring a guide</h3>
<ul>
<span>1. </span>Any type of trip or getaway that is carried out improves when you have the experience of a tour guide.<br>
<span>2. </span>Although we can always look for information on our own, what better than an expert to provide us with the most interesting information about a place.<br>
<span>3. </span>In addition, this professional will take us to specific and important points, some of which we might have overlooked. <br>
<span>4. </span>He will also give us recommendations on the best restaurants to eat at and the best stores to shop at, for example.
                        </ul>
<p>
In short, having a tour guide for a trip is important for us to know that location much better and will bring us closer to the culture and history of the destination visited.
